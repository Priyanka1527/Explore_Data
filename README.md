##Topic: Jimmy Wrangler, Data Explorer

● Required frameworks installed : Python Jupyter Notebook, Plotly

● Industry Chosen: Ride Sharing Industry
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasf/san-francisco

● Public Datasets from this industry: bike_station, bike_trips (sample used) committed under #Explore_Data/data

● Datasets were loaded into Pandas dataframe and transformed to produce a single dataset
#result_data.ipynb committed under #Explore_Data/notebooks

● Ideas: On combining the 2 datasets I could come up with the count of how many trips were taken
near to a particular landmark in the area. This could help the Rideshare company to have more
stations, docs and bikes installed in that particular area due to the increasing demand.

● The Results of the Histogram is saved under #Explore_data/reports
