**Traveling the world on a mission to discover new data**

1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Install Jupyter notebook prerequisites (Anaconda, Python, etc.)
3. Select an industry
4. Select two to three public data sets from that industry
5. Load the data sets into panda data frames following the 10 minutes to pandas guide
6. Formulate one or two ideas on how the data sets could be combined to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
7. Transform the data sets into a single data set while following data preparation processes
to clean and transform features (use pandas documentation for help)
8. Document your process and results
9. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git
repository in GitHub

● Required frameworks installed : Python Jupyter Notebook, Plotly

● Industry Chosen: Ride Sharing Industry
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasf/san-francisco

● Public Datasets from this industry: bike_station, bike_trips (sample used) committed under **_Explore_Data/data_**

● Datasets were loaded into Pandas dataframe and transformed to produce a single dataset
**_result_data.ipynb_** committed under **_Explore_Data/notebooks_**

● Ideas: On combining the 2 datasets I could come up with the count of how many trips were taken
near to a particular landmark in the area. This could help the Rideshare company to have more
stations, docs and bikes installed in that particular area due to the increasing demand.

● The Results of the Histogram is saved under **_Explore_data/reports_**
